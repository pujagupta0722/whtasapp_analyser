The second most sustainable way is to make something very useful, to solve a problem that hasn’t been solved” – Thomas Sigsgaard\\n\\n\\nWith the motive to redefine femininity for modern times, Sirona Hygiene Foundation would be conducting webinars for Rotaract clubs from all across the country to educate the members of rotaract club on Menstrual Hygiene, Sustainable Menstruation and Sustainable Menstrual Hygiene Management Products.\\n\\nAs we move ahead into the ‘new normal’, we believe that Young Adults are the protagonists of change and we at Sirona Hygiene Foundation invite you to be part of ‘Sirona’s Changemaker Squad.\\n\\nHere’s How you can be part of Sirona’s Changemaker Squad \\nAttend the advocacy session on Menstrual Hygiene, Sustainable Menstruation and Sustainable Menstrual Hygiene Management Products.\\n\\nFill in your details post attending the above session.\\n\\nReceive your ‘Sirona Changemaker Squad’ certificate on your email.\\n\\nReach out to your peers and/or educators to keep the chain reaction of change be ever growing. Keep us posted about your activities.\\n\\nWho We Are\\n\\n \\n\\nHere at Sirona Hygiene Foundation, we are driven by a single goal; to do our part in making the world a better place for all women irrespective of race, caste, social or economic background. Our decision making process is informed by comprehensive empirical studies and high quality data evaluation. We strive to build productive relationships and make a positive impact with all of our pursuits.\\n\\n \\n\\nSirona Hygiene Foundation was born in the social division of Sirona Hygiene Pvt ltd, an award winning product innovation brand, committed to solving those intimate and menstrual hygiene issues for women, which are not adequately addressed in the country. As the founder's vision of the company had been to break the stigma around menstrual hygiene and redefine femininity for modern times, the foundation endeavours to strengthen the purpose and core of this vision.\\n\\nOur Social Initiatives\\n\\nSirona Hygiene Foundation is fully dedicated to modernizing the menstrual hygiene & sanitation of India and to break the stigma related to menstruation.\\n\\nWe have successfully driven various initiatives like Project AAAN, Cup of Life, Green Menstrual Campaign, Project Nirmala and many more. Through its initiatives, it has ‘cupverted’ more than 5000 women during the dire times of 2020, while educating a lot more women for safe menstrual hygiene.\\n\\nAnd one of our ongoing initiatives is the 1 lakh cup campaign wherein we will be educating and converting One Lakh menstruators to Menstrual Cups, with an aim to provide them with a much more safer, hygienic, cost effective and sustainable menstrual hygiene management product.\\n\\nAbout Sirona (1).png\\n\\nPlease find attached the proposal presentation. \\n\\nIf you are interested in having a webinar for your club members or for any query, please reply back to this email.\\n\\nThanks and regards,\\n\\nNandini,\\n\\nSirona Hygiene Foundation\\n\",\n",
